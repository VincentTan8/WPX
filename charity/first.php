                    water."
                    Benevolence is a time-honored and world-recognized idea and
                    behavior as well as a social civilization shared by all mankind.
                    Throughout history, China has upheld the philanthropic behaviors that help the poor and the
                    difficult, developing the fine tradition of doing good for people and the world. Good deeds for
                    public interests were
                    exemplified in actions, such as the establishment of public communes and schools and the supply of
                    free rice by village families, relief of poor and sick people by religious monasteries, government's
                    disaster relief by offering national stored grain, and social efforts to help vulnerable groups.</p>
